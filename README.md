# Ramp Up Plan for Kubernetes Deployment with NGINX Forward Proxy and Load Balancer

## Task Overview:
The task involves deploying a Kubernetes cluster with NGINX as a forward proxy and load balancer. The plan includes using Helm charts and Kubernetes manifests to configure the deployment and services.

## Setup:

- **Create DB secret**
  
  kubectl create secret generic db-credentials \
  --from-literal=user=<your-db-user> \
  --from-literal=password=<your-db-password> \
  --from-literal=name=<your-db-name>

- **Install the Datadog Operator**
  
  helm repo add datadog https://helm.datadoghq.com
  helm install datadog-operator datadog/datadog-operator
  kubectl create secret generic datadog-secret --from-literal api-key=***********

- **Install HELM**
  
  helm install evershop ./
  
## Objective of the Task:

- **To create a Dockerfile for NGINX**:  
  The original task included creating a Dockerfile for NGINX. However, the project evolved to use Kubernetes `ConfigMap` for NGINX configuration management instead, which is more flexible for configuration updates.

- **To create a YAML file to describe the deployment**:  
  The YAML file is used to define the Kubernetes deployment, including all necessary configurations for the NGINX container.

- **To create a service for load balancing**:  
  The service will expose NGINX as a load balancer, distributing traffic to backend services like frontend and admin.

- **To configure readiness and liveness probes for containers**:  
  These probes ensure that the NGINX container is healthy and ready to handle traffic.  
  - **Readiness Probe** checks if the container is fully initialized.  
  - **Liveness Probe** checks if the container is alive and functional.

- **To configure the strategy of a deployment**:  
  This part of the task focuses on configuring deployment strategies, including scaling, update policies, and rollbacks.

- **To create scripts for deployment**:  
  Scripts will be created to automate the deployment of the Kubernetes cluster and NGINX components.

## Conclusion:
This task provides a comprehensive ramp-up plan for deploying NGINX as a forward proxy and load balancer in a Kubernetes cluster. By using Helm charts and Kubernetes YAML files, this solution provides scalability, fault tolerance, and ease of management.
